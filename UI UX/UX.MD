# UX Focus Areas Explained
## 🔍 1. Research – Understand the user and problem
What it means:
Research is the process of gathering information about your users, their needs, problems, behaviors, and goals before you design.

## ✅ Types of UX Research:
- User Interviews:	Talk to real users about their pain points and needs
- Surveys:	Ask questions using forms (Google Forms, Typeform)
- Competitor Analysis:	Study how similar apps/websites solve the same problems
- Analytics Review:	Use data (like Google Analytics or Hotjar) to track usage
- Field Studies:	Observe users in their real environment
- Usability Tests:	Watch users using your product and find friction

## 👤 2. User Behavior – How users actually act (not what they say)
You track or observe how users use your product.

Examples:
Where users click the most (heatmaps)

What features they ignore

Where they get stuck or confused

How long it takes to complete a task

📌 Tools: Hotjar, Google Analytics, FullStory

## 🧱 3. Wireframes – Blueprints of the design
A wireframe is a simple sketch or layout that shows what goes where on a screen — like buttons, text, images — without colors or style.

Purpose:
Plan structure and layout

Decide what content should go where

Quickly test ideas before high-fidelity UI

📌 Think of it as the rough layout of a room before decorating it.

Tools: Figma, Balsamiq, Adobe XD (low-fidelity wireframes)

## 🧭 4. Information Architecture (IA) – Organizing content clearly
IA is about how information is grouped, labeled, and structured so users can find it easily.

Example:
In an eCommerce website:

Top menu: Home, Shop, Categories, Cart

Inside "Shop": Men, Women, Electronics

Sub-categories: Phones, Laptops, Accessories

📌 It’s like the sitemap of a website.

Tools: Flowcharts (Miro, Whimsical), IA Diagrams

## 👩‍💼 5. User Personas – Fictional characters based on real users
A user persona is a profile that represents a typical user, based on research.

Includes:
Name, age, profession

Goals and frustrations

Devices they use

Behaviors and needs

📌 Helps you design for a real person, not just “everyone.”

## 🔄 6. User Flows – Path a user takes to complete a task
User flows show step-by-step what users do inside your app/website to achieve something.

Example:
Goal: Buy a phone
Flow: Homepage → Shop → Product Page → Add to Cart → Checkout → Payment

📌 Helps make sure there are no missing steps or confusion in the journey.

Tools: Miro, Whimsical, Figma

## 🧪 7. Usability Testing – Test if your design works
Test your wireframes/prototypes with real users and watch how they use it.

What to test:
Can users complete tasks?

Are buttons easy to find?

Is the layout confusing?

📌 Helps catch problems before launch.

Tools: Maze, Useberry, Lookback

🔧 8. Problem-Solving & Reducing Friction
UX designers constantly identify and fix user problems, like:

Forms that are too long

Confusing layouts

Too many steps to complete a task

📌 Goal: Make the experience simple, fast, enjoyable.
